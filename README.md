# HOOD_tools
A couple of programmes to calibrate the hood and to run a test there.

You need the HOOD_CALIBRATION_DATA.mat file whatever it is you want to do. It stores the saved data for the calibrations.
CALIBRATE_HOOD.m is required for calibration.
RUN_TEST_HOOD.m is needed to run the test.

In both cases you run the script by pressing the green triangle at the top of the Matlab editor.
